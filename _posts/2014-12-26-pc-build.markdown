I wanted to build my own PC. So, on a budget of about $1500, I started to research and pick out the components I wanted for a fast, reliable computer for gaming and school work.

## Specs
These are the components that I chose for my PC:
* Intel Core i7-4790K Processor
* Corsair H55 CPU Liquid Cooler
* Asus Z97-A Motherboard
* Corsair Vengeance Pro 16GB DDR3-1866 Memory
* Samsung 850 EVO 120GB SSD
