## Purpose
I wanted to build my own PC. So, for Christmas, my parents gave me a budget and told me to research and pick out the components I wanted to fit the budget. I researched components, chose the components that best fit my budget, and built myself a new PC.

## Parts
These are the components that I chose for my PC:
* Intel Core i7-4790K Processor
* Corsair H55 CPU Liquid Cooler
* Asus Z97-A Motherboard
* Corsair Vengeance Pro 16GB DDR3-1866 Memory
* Samsung 850 EVO 120GB SSD
* Western Digital BLACK 1TB 7200RPM
* EVGA GeForce GTX 970 FTW Video Card
* Corsair 760T White Case
* Corsair RM 850W Fully-Modular Power Supply
* Microsoft Windows 10 Pro 64-bit
* TP-Link PCI-Express Wi-Fi Adapter
* Cougar 140mm Green LED Fan x3
* NZXT Hue+ LED Lighting
