After cleaning out our garage the previous summer, I thought it would be cool to have a workshop space in the garage. Instead of being limited to the small number of pre-made workbench's available for sale, I decided to design and build my own from standard hardware store lumber and the common hand tools I had discovered when organizing the tools in our garage.

## Materials
* 2x 4x4x96 inch non pressure treated lumber
* 4x 2x4x96 inch standard wood studs
* 30x80 Solid Core wooden unfinished door
* 3 inch self-drilling wood screws
* Workbench Vise
* Large bolts to mount the vise

## Details
First, I made a 3D CAD model of the workbench to ensure all of the features that I wanted would work. Since our garage space is fairly limited, I wanted to incorporate our large rolling toolbox, which stores all our hand tools underneath the new workbench. To make the design nice and strong from all directions, I chose a construction method where I in-set the smaller 2x4's into notched in the 4x4's and secure it with multiple long screws. I, then, mounted our small workbench vise to the solid core wooden door, which we repurposed as a workbench top, with 4 large bolts and nuts. My CAD design can be found [here](http://wbenb.github.io/assets/workbench-cad.pdf).
