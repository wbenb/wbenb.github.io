Using a inexpensive kit of parts available online, I assembled a DIY universal component tester. With the kit, there is a good amount of soldering that is required. The tester is coming in very handy as it can measure test a wide range of 2 and 3 pin components including diodes/LEDs, transistors, mosfets, resistors, and capacitors. It even gives a complete pinout for the device no matter which way around you connect insert it in the tester.
