As a part of my senior capstone engineering project at VCU, I worked with [Professor Shawn Chen, Ph.D.](https://egr.vcu.edu/directory/shawn.chen/) and Lee Harrelson, PE from [CMTA Inc.](https://www.cmta.com/) in Richmond Virginia. CMTA is a engineering and consulting firm specializing in sustainable, zero energy, LEED certified buildings.

When VCU had the [College of Health Professions building](https://chp.vcu.edu/about/building/) designed and built, it was a $87 million, 8 floor, 154,000 square foot facility that they specified to meet of exceed the LEED Silver certification requirement, symbolizing good energy efficiency. However, shortly after the building was commissioned and opened for use, they realized that something was seriously wrong and were receiving much larger than expected bills for the electricity and steam consumption.
