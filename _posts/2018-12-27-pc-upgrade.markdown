description:   Four years after I originally built my first desktop computer from parts that I researched, I decided it was time to update it. I rebuilt the old components into a new case and wired it with new white fans and sleeved cables to complete the look.

The main purpose of this upgrade process was to rebuild my desktop computer, which I use for everything from homework to video games, into a newer more modern case that better suits my application. My old case was the full-tower Corsair 760T in white, it is a great case, but it is very large and not easy to transport, and the easy open plastic side panel is convenient put not the best looking. The new case that I picked is the [Phanteks Evolv ATX TG](https://phanteks.com/Enthoo-Evolv-ATX-TemperedGlass.html) in anthracite grey. It is a mid-tower case made out of thick aluminum with tempered glass side panels and a very well laid out interior with minimal exposed fan grill on the top.

While performing this upgrade, I also decided to ditch the green color scheme in favor of more neutral colors that would work better with any color that I could set the NZXT Hue+ LED strips to. To do this, I replaced all the fans with Arctic PWM controlled fans with white blades, and added a set of CableMod individually sleeved white cables to my build. In this end, my new PC build looks cooler, is smaller, doesn't take up as much room on my desk, is easier to transport, and the case looks and feels much higher quality with the all aluminum and tempered glass chassis.
